"""ESDDNS Web-Service with Flask
Flask application launches with ESDDNS to heat up dynamic cache, initiates
background daemon thread as scheduled daemon to manage the dynamic cache, interval is 
configured in configuration file.
    
How It Works:

    Initialize current_state() and g_cached_state() with Flask application context,
    i.e. when Flask application starts. To address the cold start scenario where user
    would have waited for the first request response to populate the current 
    ESDDNS state. 
    
    Scheduling a daemon to run ESDDNS in background also takes place right after 
    initial current_state() call in Flask application context.  

    FLASK application context is only used to pre-heat the cache for cold start, and 
    to render the state populated as dynamic global cached state.

    The global dynamic cached state gets refreshed each time daemon exuctes (runs 
    the current_state function). 

    Daemon is scheduled `interval` retrieved from configs and will run forever until
    service is forced to stop.    

Returns:

    - Dictionary: ESDDNS State 
        - Syncrhonized Union of managed WAN IP and DNS A Record states

    - endpoint: `http://localhost:port/`
        - HTML template with current ESDDNS state for example
            - Current ESDDNS State:
                - State Poll Date: 2023-04-02 20:12:00
                - WAN IP State: 
                    - Is IP address usable?: True
                    - Your WAN IPv4 address: xx.xx.xx.xx
                - DNS Record State: 
                    - Is DNS Record in sync?: True
                    - Recordset Data:
                        - Record Set Name: @
                        - Record Set Type: A
                        - Record Set Time To Live: 300
                        - Record Set Values: ['xx.xx.xx.xx']
                        - Record Set HREF:
